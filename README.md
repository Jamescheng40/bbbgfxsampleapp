This code hub is strictly dedicated toward Researching and development only. 

The project aims at reverse engineering of SGX530 on BeagleBoard Black aka the only blobs on that board. 

Some of the tools and method are inspired from https://garnet.codeberg.page/posts/gpu-reversing/ and https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-1.html
